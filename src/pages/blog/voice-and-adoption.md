I read [this summary of smart speaker usage](https://voicebot.ai/2020/05/03/streaming-music-questions-weather-timers-and-alarms-remain-smart-speaker-killer-apps-third-party-voice-app-usage-not-growing/) and was struck by how little adoption third party smart speaker apps are gaining. It's not particularly _surprising_: just ask anyone not familiar with the technology if they've used an alexa skill. I just feel the third party ecosystem would have been more robust by now.

#### A Quick Note on Discoverability

From what I've been reading, there's a ton of discourse in the voice application community on discoverability. Sure, discoverability is really important for lots of applications. Ask yourself this: how many of the applications on your phone did you install after finding them in the app store?

#### It's the use cases

This is the core question. What are the use cases that you're enabling with voice? What makes users come back every day?

Right now those use cases are really few and far between in the alexa skill store.
