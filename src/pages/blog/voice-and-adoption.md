I read [this summary of smart speaker usage](https://voicebot.ai/2020/05/03/streaming-music-questions-weather-timers-and-alarms-remain-smart-speaker-killer-apps-third-party-voice-app-usage-not-growing/) and was struck by how little adoption third party smart speaker apps are gaining. It's not particularly _surprising_: just ask anyone not familiar with the technology if they've used an alexa skill. It seems like the third party ecosystem would have been more robust by now.

#### A Quick Note on Discoverability

From what I've been reading, there's a ton of discourse in the voice application community on discoverability. Sure, discoverability is really important for lots of applications. Ask yourself this: how many of the applications on your phone did you install after finding them in the app store?

I don't think discoverability is the key. If users were getting consistent value, we'd see adoption.

#### It's all about jobs to be done

_What can your user accomplish that they can't accomplish easier by picking up their phone?_

I think the Jeopardy skill is an excellent example--it's actually easier to dictate answers to Jeopardy than it is to write them on your phone.

There are a ton of reasons why the subset of jobs to be done with third party voice apps is really small right now. What do you think is the key?
